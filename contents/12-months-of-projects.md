I learned over the past few years that I love to try out new things, but rarely do these things stick. I often end up forgetting about them or losing interest. Take for example my drawing tablet. It came with free software used by many digital artists. I would not have to pay for Adobe's expensive Creative Cloud suite. But here's the thing, I only used it five times. Once to redraw my favorite sketch, once to animate a ball bouncing up and down, and then a few more times with no goal in mind. So what happened?

When I try out a new hobby I'm quick to find something that makes me want to stop. Sometimes it's a thought like "I'm not good enough", sometimes I realize it is too time-consuming, or sometimes I found something else to try. I spent a lot of time in 2020 exploring new activities like bouldering, miniature painting, skateboarding, yoga, and chess. As it turns out these are my top five hobbies from the past year so I thought if I could find five new things I enjoyed last year then I should keep looking for something new this year.

I will be giving myself one month to complete each project. On the first day, I'll decide what I want to work on and set a goal for myself. Over the next four weeks, I will work towards it and at the end, I'll release a blog post to share my experience. I do not have a detailed plan of what projects I want to complete and when, but I do have a list of things I'm interested in. So stay tuned and see what new things I try and which one's I like the most. I'm already off to a late start so I better get moving!
